# CIS106-Owen-Carney

## Assignment 1

I am taking CIS106 as a prerequisite for future computer science classes as I intend for my major to be computer science. I feel that this class is also a good beginning point for me to get involved with coding and get used to the basics of it. So far after doing the first chapter it does feel like this will be a lot of work, but I believe that this class and major are right for me and that I can prosper through them to become a programmer/software developer of some sort. I have always had a intrest in computers and how the programs on them fuction and work. As well as a want to understand how I can create them myself.
