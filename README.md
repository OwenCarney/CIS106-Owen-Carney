# CIS106-Owen-Carney

## Assignment 1

I am taking CIS106 as a prerequisite for future computer science classes as I intend for my major to be computer science. I feel that this class is also a good beginning point for me to get involved with coding and get used to the basics of it. So far after doing the first chapter it does feel like this will be a lot of work, but I believe that this class and major are right for me and that I can prosper through them to become a programmer/software developer of some sort. I have always had a intrest in computers and how the programs on them fuction and work. As well as a want to understand how I can create them myself.

## Assignment 2

This week I took my first steps to doing some type of code and using the software Flowgorithm and Thonny for the first time. I was able to create code that says Hello World! and then asks the user for their age and if they are of at least 18 it will ask them for their name and say hello to that name. It was more then what the assignment asked for, but to me I wanted to mess around with Flowgorithm a little more and see if I could do something with a if then statement instead of just what its your name. Overall I think it was a good week for getting introduced to software.
